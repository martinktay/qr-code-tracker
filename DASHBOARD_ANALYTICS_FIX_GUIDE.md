# Dashboard Analytics Fix Guide

## Problem Summary
The Admin Dashboard was showing incorrect analytics (all zeros) due to several issues:
1. **AuthContext getUserRole errors**: 406 Not Acceptable errors when fetching user roles
2. **Dashboard query errors**: 400 Bad Request errors when fetching boxes/sacks data
3. **AdminPanel function errors**: Undefined function errors in the admin panel
4. **Missing database columns**: Some required columns were missing from the schema

## Issues Fixed

### 1. AuthContext getUserRole Fix
**Problem**: The function was using `.single()` which caused 406 errors when no user account existed.

**Solution**: 
- Changed to `.maybeSingle()` to handle cases where no user account exists
- Added better error handling with default role fallback
- Removed timeout mechanism that was causing issues

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/supabase.js` - Updated `getUserRole` function
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Simplified `fetchUserRole` function

### 2. Dashboard Query Fixes
**Problem**: Queries were failing due to missing columns and poor error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling to all dashboard fetch functions
- Updated queries to include `weight_kg` column
- Added try-catch blocks to prevent crashes
- Used `maybeSingle()` instead of `single()` for customer queries

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Updated all fetch functions with error handling

### 3. AdminPanel Function Fixes
**Problem**: Syntax error in `deleteUser` function was causing undefined function errors.

**Solution**:
- Fixed syntax error in `deleteUser` function
- Properly separated `editUser` function definition
- Ensured all functions are properly defined and accessible

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/AdminPanel.jsx` - Fixed function definitions

### 4. Database Schema Updates
**Problem**: Missing columns and RLS policy issues.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive SQL fix file
- Added missing columns with proper defaults
- Recreated RLS policies
- Added performance indexes

**Files Created**:
- `fix_dashboard_analytics.sql` - Complete database schema fix

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Fixes
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_dashboard_analytics.sql`
4. Execute the script
5. Verify that all tables have the required columns

### Step 2: Test the Application
1. Refresh your application
2. Log in as an admin user
3. Navigate to the Dashboard
4. Check that analytics are now showing correct numbers
5. Test the Admin Panel user management functions

### Step 3: Verify Functionality
1. **Dashboard Analytics**: Should show correct counts for boxes, sacks, weight, etc.
2. **User Management**: Edit and delete user functions should work
3. **Console Errors**: Should be significantly reduced or eliminated

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

### Dashboard Analytics
- **Total Boxes**: Should show actual count from database
- **Total Sacks**: Should show actual count from database  
- **Total Weight**: Should show sum of all parcel weights
- **Status Counts**: Should show correct breakdown by status
- **Recent Parcels**: Should display actual recent parcels

### Console Errors
- **AuthContext errors**: Should be eliminated
- **Dashboard query errors**: Should be eliminated
- **AdminPanel function errors**: Should be eliminated

### User Management
- **Edit User**: Should work without errors
- **Delete User**: Should work without errors
- **Create User**: Should work properly

## Troubleshooting

### If Analytics Still Show Zero
1. Check browser console for any remaining errors
2. Verify that the SQL script executed successfully
3. Check that RLS policies are properly applied
4. Ensure you're logged in with an admin account

### If User Management Still Has Issues
1. Check that the `editUser` and `toggleParcelSelection` functions are properly defined
2. Verify that the database has the required columns
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### If RLS Issues Persist
1. Run the RLS policy section of the SQL script again
2. Check Supabase logs for policy violations
3. Verify that authentication is working properly

## Database Schema Verification

After running the fix script, verify these columns exist:

### Boxes Table
- `weight_kg` (DECIMAL)
- `status` (VARCHAR)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### Sacks Table  
- `weight_kg` (DECIMAL)
- `status` (VARCHAR)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### User Accounts Table
- `phone` (VARCHAR)
- `name` (VARCHAR)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### Messages Table
- `recipient_type` (VARCHAR)
- `customer_id` (UUID)

## Performance Improvements

The fix script also includes:
- Database indexes for better query performance
- Proper RLS policies for security
- Default values for missing data

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Watch for any remaining console errors
2. **Test All Features**: Ensure all dashboard features work correctly
3. **Data Validation**: Verify that the analytics match your actual data
4. **User Testing**: Have users test the application to ensure everything works

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after applying these fixes:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify that all SQL commands executed successfully
3. Ensure your Supabase project has the correct permissions
4. Test with a fresh browser session to clear any cached data
