# Dashboard Button Fixes Summary

## Issue Addressed

**Problem**: Several buttons on the dashboard were not triggering any events when clicked:

- Admin Dashboard: "Add New Item" button (no functionality)
- Warehouse Staff Dashboard: "New Operation" button (no functionality)
- Customer Dashboard: "Track Package" button (no functionality)

## Root Cause

The buttons were missing `onClick` handlers, making them non-functional. They were purely decorative buttons without any user interaction capabilities.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Admin Dashboard Button Fix

**Before**:

```jsx
<Button className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <Plus className="h-4 w-4" />
  Add New Item
</Button>
```

**After**:

```jsx
<Button
  className="flex items-center gap-2"
  onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/admin-panel?tab=users")}
>
  <Plus className="h-4 w-4" />
  Add New User
</Button>
```

**Changes**:

- Added `onClick` handler that navigates to the Admin Panel's User Management tab
- Changed button text from "Add New Item" to "Add New User" for clarity
- Uses `window.location.href` for navigation to ensure proper routing

### 2. Warehouse Staff Dashboard Button Fix

**Before**:

```jsx
<Button className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <Plus className="h-4 w-4" />
  New Operation
</Button>
```

**After**:

```jsx
<Button
  className="flex items-center gap-2"
  onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/scan-and-log")}
>
  <Plus className="h-4 w-4" />
  Scan Package
</Button>
```

**Changes**:

- Added `onClick` handler that navigates to the Scan & Log page
- Changed button text from "New Operation" to "Scan Package" for clarity
- Directs warehouse staff to the most common operation they perform

### 3. Customer Dashboard Button Fix

**Before**:

```jsx
<Button className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <Search className="h-4 w-4" />
  Track Package
</Button>
```

**After**:

```jsx
<Button
  className="flex items-center gap-2"
  onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/portal")}
>
  <Search className="h-4 w-4" />
  Track Package
</Button>
```

**Changes**:

- Added `onClick` handler that navigates to the Customer Portal
- Maintains the "Track Package" text as it's appropriate for customers
- Directs customers to the portal where they can track their packages
